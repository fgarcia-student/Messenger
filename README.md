# \#Messenger README

## Synopsis

Messenger is a real time chat application built entirely with React and Redux, using Node and Express to build the API and MongoDB as the database.

## Motivation

I built this project while interviewing for positions as a Front-End Web Developer here in NYC. My goal with this project is to show my ability to develop applications using React, Redux, Node, and MongoDB. I will continue to develop this application, and feedback or issues are completely welcome.

## Installation

To install this either clone my repo or download it as a zip. In console run the following commands:

Using yarn
`Run 'yarn install' to download all of the required packages`

Once complete you should be able to launch the application using `yarn start`
